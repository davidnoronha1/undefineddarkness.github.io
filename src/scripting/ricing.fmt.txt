-- Introduction --
This is my own take on the ricing guide.
It is mainly meant for some one who is willing to research and try stuff out themselves, as in it is more
ricing documentation rather than a tutorial.

-- Design --
Everything in your rice <b>must</b> follow a colorscheme!. This is very important
Example of a well thought out colorscheme: https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/p6tyf4/bspwm_us_and_them/
bad one: https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/p743yq/gnome_neon_i_guess/
Try to make sure something looks good! If you arent sure try to ask people and get feedback.
Getting good feedback makes a great importance.

Find a good wallpaper and constantly experiment to try to improve parts of your rice, 
even if it doesnt get you anywhere at least you might learn something!

---- Software Doesnt Matter ----
Generally you can use whatever software you like as long as it works. There is no need to switch software unless you current one lacks
an essential feature.

Distro doesnt matter either! You can rice equally well on any distro

---- Pay Attention To Fonts ----
Many people neglect this, so ill bring it up:
USE GOOD FONTS!
They make a great visual impact and often can be used to accent / highlight stuff really well.

Using bitmap fonts can bring an entirely different vibe to a rice.
My list of certified good fonts (fonts I like):
- [Iosevka](http://be5invis.github.io/Iosevka)
- [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/)
- [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) ~ The regular version is sorta terrible
- [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)
- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

-- Terminal Comparison --
The terminal is a linux's users primary mode of communicating with their system (usually)
as such it is one place that requires particular attention while ricing, one's choice of terminal
also matters greatly, these are the most common options & their strengths / weaknesses:

#TABLE 	Name	Wayland	Ligatures	Image	Tabs/Splits	Font-Fallback	Speed	Config	Implementation
	 [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)	Y	p	N	N	N	good	yaml	rs
	 [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)	Y	Y	Y	Y	N	avg	custom	py/c
	 [St](https://st.suckless.org/)	N	p	p	N	p	good	c	c
	 [Xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/)	N	N	N	N	N	good	xres	c
	 [Foot](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot)	Y	N	Y	N	N	good	ini	c
	 [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)	      Y	Y	Y	          Y	            Y	  avg	   lua	            rs
#END TABLE

NOTE:
`p` means it can be used with a patch.
foot is wayland only.
wezterm's wayland backend has been reported to have a few issues.
