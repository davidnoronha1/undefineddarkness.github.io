A description of the bad time I've had with my new laptop
#END HEADER

A review of my new laptop but mostly a list of the issues I've had with it with a few graphs if I get the time hehe
ðŸ˜…, The missing key in the above image is fully my fault so I'm not mentioning that

## Software Issues
### Booting Issues
This piece of shit can't boot stablelly into any operating system, Windows needs to reboot 3 times before getting to the login page, same with Ubuntu 24.04, It gets really frustrating, I'll try recording a video of the same

### Poweroff / Reboot Issues
This one affects Linux a lot more than Windows but the laptop will just reboot and poweroff w/o any notice at all, there are no kernel logs of the same and w/h it happens on windows, Event Viewer just lists it as a unexpected poweroff ðŸ˜­, THIS IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING, Since especially on Linux it can die within 5-10 minutes and fucks up a wide variety of software that don't expect to just randomly loose power like Vim, Git, Fixing git repos cuz they got corrupted due to this takes forever

## Build Quality Issues
I'll admit I'm not the most careful laptop user on this planet, but this one feels particularly poor despite the few bumps and knocks I've put the laptop through.

### Screws falling out
Apparently this isn't a thing just w/ my laptop but has happened with a friends laptop of the same model, The bottom screws (ESPECIALLY THE ONES NEAR THE HINGE) have a very frustrating tendancy to just FALL OUT whenever they feel like and since this usually happens w/h the laptop is being carried in a backpack, you'll pretty much never be able to find the screws again
W/o any screws to hold it down the hinge just goes nuts and completley breaks and the laptop starts splitting apart w/h you try opening it normally so you have to kind of put pressure w/h the screw would be and then _very carefully_ open it, Till the screen opens and can start putting weight in the same area
