# Cheapino
For a long time I've wanted to make a custom keyboard, My first *actual* mechanical keyboard is/was like the cheapest RedDragon keyboard with **blue** switches, and while I was really grateful to have it, I always wanted to either make a 60% eventually or something more exquisite 

Being around some Linux discord servers, it wasn't rare to meet someone with a really fancy keyboard setup like splits orthos and what not

Then I stumbled across the Cheapino w/h was supposed to be the cheapest _usable_ split
