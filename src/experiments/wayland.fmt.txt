This is intended to chronicle my adventures using Wayland

<h2>* Window Manager (Compositer)</h2>
I know its called a compositer but I am going to call it a window manager >:(
To fulfill this purpose I chose <a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway</a> as its the one I felt I could most get used to
since I had used its Xorg brother (i3) for a long while

And..
It works really well! its performance is very impressive compared to what I am used to
I have a few scruples with its config format and its refusal to add features i3 lacks but oh well..,
not like I'm gonna be writing my own compositer any time soon

Coming from awesomewm, I would have liked to find something similar 
and that sort of exists in the form of <a href="https://taiwins.org/index.html">Taiwins</a> but its very different from what I am used to 
and I am not keen on using it as it is rather unstable and documentation is lacking

<h3>** Screenshots</h3>
What is the point of making a epic rice if there is no way to showcase it!
Wayland seems a bit more fiddly compared to the centeralized xorg in terms of recording 
but its not that bad. I had to use <a href="https://github.com/emersion/grim">grim</a> along with this <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/contrib/grimshot">script</a> from sway to get
Nothing particularly difficult but not as cohesive as id like :/

<h2>* Moving from Xorg</h2>
This is a bit of a generic header but oh well

Much to my surprise this wasnt as bad as I thought it would be,
rofi, wezterm, firefox & dunst - all programs I am used to from Xorg could work 
natively (without Xwayland) on wayland

Although most of them required tweaking in some form or another

<b>ROFI:</b> This does use a fork
>git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lbonn/rofi
>cd rofi
>meson setup build -Dwayland=enabled --prefix=/usr/local
>ninja -C build
>ninja -C build install

<b>FIREFOX:</b> Might need to modify some desktop files to get it to work right
> MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 firefox
