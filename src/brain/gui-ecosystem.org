#+TITLE: GUI Experiments
This is a experiment to try out various native GUI frameworks and try to find one I can bear with.
It involves creating a +really simple TODO+ app in several frameworks,
The ones I have chosen for this experiment are:

- Flutter
- GTK 3
- Godot (The game engine)
- Web (Electron / Website)
- Egui

The code for Godot will be written in it's own GDScript,
GTK 3 will use C, Flutter Dart, Web JS ... you get the idea.

I am purposely using egui instead of dear imgui since I don't want to spend time learning / setting up C++
and not for much other reason.
