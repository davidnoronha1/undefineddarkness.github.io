** GUI Experiments
This is a experiment to try out various native GUI frameworks and try to find one I can bear with.
It involves creating a really simple TODO app in several frameworks,
The ones I have chosen for this experiment are:

- Flutter
- GTK 3
- Godot (The game engine)
- Web (Electron / Website)
- Nuklear

The code for Godot will be written in it's own GDScript,
GTK 3 & Nuklear will use C, Flutter Dart, Web JS ... you get the idea.
