# Programming languages I like
Disclaimer: I havent used any of these languages for a long time or written a project of significant note
(except lua and javascript, those I know fairly well I think)
with any of them, These are just my opinons on them from what ive heard and what little ive tried of them.
So please take this with a grain of salt, üßÇ  

#TABLE	.tierlist
Happy	Rust	Kotlin	C#
Interested	Haskell	Erlang	Clojure
Boring	JS	Lua	Dart	Python	Typescript
Stinky	C	Java	PHP	Perl
Not Good	Go	Perl	Elisp
#END TABLE

The languages in "Interesting" are ones I dont know particularly well...
So I might move them around when I finally get to learning them properly.

### Of particular note:

<strike>I havent played with C#, but it looks really similar to Java so it gets to share its spot.
It might be better than I've heard, no idea.</strike>
I have played around with it a bit now and it is quite nice, finally understood OOP a bit while using it.

Clojure is just a rather good lisp :)
Racket is lower because it isnt like clojure where it can leverage the JVM and its a bit umm slow, not to say clojure isnt slow, it is as well but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

C is kind of fun to write in a way but it gets really frustrating pretty quickly,
I still havent been to write a C program without running into memory issues at least once, but I am not skilled with it.
But using Rust nets me most of the things I'd like to use C for and a far far better development experience so I haven't had much reason to learn it outside of curiosity.
Still waiting for Zig to be decent but looks like I'll have to wait a while.

Lua might be the most *neat* & consise language I have ever seen, only everything you strictly need is
included, and almost all of it is really well designed. Not that remarkable a language tho,
and indexing from 1 (and its for loop syntax) might not have been the smartest idea but its not that hard to get used to.
Probably are some lisps that do the same thing.
