# ðŸŒ¾ How do I rice X?
My own take at a ricing guide.
Most of it is useless if you already know, and it only covers the **very** very basics.

## Firefox
You can customize the User Interface (Chrome) with Firefox CSS,
See the following:
- https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials
- https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/

### Start Page
You will need basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JS
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a nice place to learn

Firefox has quite a few limitations on setting local files as your start page
( No external requests or imports of any kind ) so in my opinion, its easiest to simply host your start page on some static
site hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Surge.sh)

Then use [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) extension to set the URL.
Chromium Users can use [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) instead (chrome places no limitations)

## GTK
This is most easily accomplished by forking an existing theme and modifying them, Most themes are open source and
are easily modifiable (if you know CSS). Phocus is a nice one to start with. (https://github.com/phocus/gtk)

GTK CSS Reference: https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html
Using the GTK Debugger: https://elkowar.github.io/eww/working_with_gtk.html#gtk-debugger (This should work anywhere)

## (Neo)Vim
This is an interesting one, If you use a pre - made colorscheme chances are a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) or other vim theme
already exists for it, Otherwise you can make a base16 theme or make one from a wide variety of templates,
There even exist generators for it. ([Pinto](https://pintovim.dev/), [Vivify](https://bytefluent.com/vivify/))

And of course if a colorscheme is similar to yours, you can easily fork it and modify.

Besides colors, in terms of functionality you are free to find / forge whatever to fit your needs.

## Terminal
I am bored now.
