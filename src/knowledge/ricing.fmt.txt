# ðŸŒ¾ How do I rice X?
My own take at a ricing guide.
Most of it is useless if you already know, and it only covers the **very** very basics.

#- ðŸ¦Š Firefox
You can customize the User Interface (Chrome) with Firefox CSS,
See the following:
- https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials
- https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/

### Start Page
You will need basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JS
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a nice place to learn

Firefox has quite a few limitations on setting local files as your start page
( No external requests or imports of any kind ) so in my opinion, its easiest to simply host your start page on some static
site hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Surge.sh)

Then use [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) extension to set the URL.
Chromium Users can use [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) instead (chrome places no limitations)

#- GTK
This is most easily accomplished by forking an existing theme and modifying them, Most themes are open source and
are easily modifiable (if you know CSS). Phocus is a nice one to start with. (https://github.com/phocus/gtk)

GTK CSS Reference: https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html
Using the GTK Debugger: https://elkowar.github.io/eww/working_with_gtk.html#gtk-debugger (This should work anywhere)

#- (Neo)Vim
This is an interesting one, If you use a pre - made colorscheme chances are a [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) or other vim theme
already exists for it, Otherwise you can make a base16 theme or make one from a wide variety of templates,
There even exist generators for it. ([Pinto](https://pintovim.dev/), [Vivify](https://bytefluent.com/vivify/))

And of course if a colorscheme is similar to yours, you can easily fork it and modify.

Besides colors, in terms of functionality you are free to find / forge whatever to fit your needs.
See more on vim & neovim: [here](/out/knowledge/vim.html)

#- Terminal
This is really simple too, Popular color schemes usually have port for common terminal programs, even if it doesn't, it should still be really simple
to implement, its just 16 colors after all :P

### Comparison
This is a general comparison of the most common terminal emulators as of October 2021.

#END TABLE

**Notes:**
OTF = Open Type Features such as stylistic sets and the like
P = With a patch or a fork
Foot is wayland only.
If you are looking into using st, I highly suggest you use https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch instead as it is much easier to use and modify.

# ðŸŽ¨ Design Recommendations
Stuff related to the general design of a rice

## Typography
> The style and appearance of printed matter.

This is one place where you can really stand out and using a good font can make all the difference for both the looks of your rice as well as its usability.
Generally you will need 3 font faces:
- A sans serif face for general user interface
- A mono space font for code
- A serif fonts for documents

More on the differences between serif, sans-serif and mono space: https://www.canva.com/learn/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts/

Here are a fonts I personally like for each one:
