#DIVIDER INSPIRATION


JavaCafe's rice has been a great resource and inspiration
and many parts have come from there and undergone modification
(https://github.com/JavaCafe01/awedots)

bunny's herbsluft rice has been an inspiration for the sidebar, dashboard etc
(https://github.com/rayes0/dotfiles)

no37's rice has been inspiration for the vertical bar and some sidebar design
(https://github.com/Nooo37/dots)

Cool stuff:

Bling is an awesome library if you use awesomewm, it includes several high-quality
widgets and many ease-of-use features
(https://github.com/BlingCorp/bling)

Eww is a widget framework that can be used to create amazing widgets in any wm!

Elkowar's Phocus is a very nice gtk theme (for gruvbox) 
and I have recreated its pretty window buttons for my rice
