<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</header>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>What distribution do I use?<br/>
It really does not matter for the purpose of Ricing, If you are new to Linux,<br/>
Ill recommend Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora to start with.<br/>
</li>
<li>What do people use?<br/>
See these <a href="/out/ricing/graphs/index.html">graphs</a> I made<br/>
</li>
</ul><br/><h2> Common Jargon</h2>
<p>
Covers many of the uncommon words used in relation to ricing or linux desktop usage in general,<br/>
I have tried to make it in as simple english as possible but there will still be a few words that slip in.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h3> Window Manager (WM)</h3>
<p>
This one is quite basic, It means it manages your windows, any functionality outside of that shouldnt be derived from this, Generally in charge of:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Window Placement (floating, tilinig)<br/>
</li>
<li>Window Resizing  (maximize, minimize)<br/>
</li>
<li>Window Titlebars <br/>
</li>
<li>Keybind Management<br/>
</li>
</ul><br/>Eg: i3 bspwm awesomewm dwm<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<h3> Desktop Enviroment (DE)</h3>
<p>
A much more complete version of a window manager, It can be considered an entire desktop with its own technology, application, design,<br/>
Its held to a much higher standard than a window manager and can be considered a full computing enviroment.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Window Manager<br/>
</li>
<li>Applications<br/>
</li>
<li>Consistent Settings Menu<br/>
</li>
<li>Customization by a GUI ^<br/>
</li>
