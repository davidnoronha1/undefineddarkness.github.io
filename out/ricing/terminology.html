<h1 id='heading-1'>Common Jargon</h1>
Covers many of the uncommon words used in relation to ricing or linux desktop usage in general,
I have tried to make it in as simple english as possible but there will still be a few words that slip in.

<h3 id='heading-2'>Window Manager (WM)</h3>
This one is quite basic, It means it manages your windows, any functionality outside of that shouldnt be derived from this, Generally in charge of:
<ul><li>Window Placement (floating, tilinig)
</li><li>Window Resizing  (maximize, minimize)
</li><li>Window Titlebars
</li><li>Keybind Management
</li></ul>Eg: i3 bspwm awesomewm dwm

<h3 id='heading-3'>Desktop Enviroment (DE)</h3>
A much more complete version of a window manager, It can be considered an entire desktop with its own technology, application, design,
Its held to a much higher standard than a window manager and can be considered a full computing enviroment.
<ul><li>Window Manager
</li><li>Applications
</li><li>Consistent Settings Menu
</li><li>Customization by a GUI ^
</li></ul>Eg: Xfce Gnome KDE
