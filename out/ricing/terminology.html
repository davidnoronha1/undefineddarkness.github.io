<h1> Common Jargon</h1>
Covers many of the uncommon words used in relation to ricing or linux desktop usage in general,<br/>
I have tried to make it in as simple english as possible but there will still be a few words that slip in.<br/>
<br/>
<h3> Window Manager (WM)</h3>
This one is quite basic, It means it manages your windows, any functionality outside of that shouldnt be derived from this, Generally in charge of:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Window Placement (floating, tilinig)</li>
<li>Window Resizing  (maximize, minimize)</li>
<li>Window Titlebars </li>
<li>Keybind Management</li>
</ul><br/>Eg: i3 bspwm awesomewm dwm<br/>
<br/>
<h3> Desktop Enviroment (DE)</h3>
A much more complete version of a window manager, It can be considered an entire desktop with its own technology, application, design,<br/>
Its held to a much higher standard than a window manager and can be considered a full computing enviroment.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Window Manager</li>
<li>Applications</li>
<li>Consistent Settings Menu</li>
<li>Customization by a GUI ^</li>
</ul><br/>Eg: Xfce Gnome KDE<br/>
