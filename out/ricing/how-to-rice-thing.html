<summary>Emacs</summary>
<p>
The youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/systemcrafters">System Crafters</a> has already created a significant amount of resources regarding getting starting with emacs, 
You can find them <a href="https://wiki.systemcrafters.cc/emacs/">here</a> - See the Emacs From Scratch series for an indepth series of writinig your own configuraton,
But as usual, Do not follow them word for word, Experiment your own and try to understand what each and every setting does :D

Customizing emacs is 90% about your own passion, There is a lot you can do

<h4 id="####-How to make it fast"> How to make it fast</h4>
<p>
A pretty useless pursuit since emacs comes with its daemon mode which ought to take care of most people's need for speed,
But this is kinda fun so a few basic tips are here to make it faster at starting up:

<figure>
<blockquote>
Some of these techniques for fast startup I've documented in our <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly">FAQ</a>.

The highlights are:

<ul>
<li>I suppress garbage collection during startup,
</li>
<li>I lazy load our package manager. This means avoiding package-initialize or, if you use straight like Doom does, bootstrapping straight. It also means no 200+ package-installed-p checks on startup.
</li>
<li>Package autoloads files are concatenated into one, large file. This saves on hundreds of file reads at startup (assuming you have hundreds of packages installed). I byte-compile it too.
</li>
<li>Almost all our packages are lazy loaded (iirc, 2-3 out of 300 are not).

The biggest gains come from lazy loading packages. Especially the big ones, like org, helm, and magit. Doom goes a bit further with this. A couple examples:

</li>
<li>Dozens of packages (like recentf, savehist, autorevert, etc) are deferred until your first input (pre-command-hook) or the first file is opened (:before after-find-file).
</li>
<li>Org's babel packages aren't loaded all at once with org-babel-do-load-languages, but on demand when their src blocks are encountered (fontified) or executed. Same with its export backends.
</li>
<li>Doom loads some larger packages incrementally while it is idle. i.e. After 2s afk, it loads one of dash, f, s, with-editor, git-commit, package, eieio, lv, then transient every second, before finally loading magit (these are its dependencies). This process bows out when it detects user activity, and continues later when Emacs has been idle again for 2s. This helps with that first-time-load delay when starting magit. org and helm get similar treatment.
</li>
<li>If you use the daemon, the incremental-loader just loads them all immediately.

Besides that, I've collected tidbits of elisp over the years that appear to help startup time, sometimes inexplicably. Here are a couple off the top of my head:

    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "Fira Code-14")) instead of (set-frame-font "Fira Code-14" t t). The latter does more work than the former, under the hood.

    (setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t) -- Emacs resizes the (GUI) frame when your newly set font is larger (or smaller) than the system default. This seems to add 0.4-1s to startup.

    (setq initial-major-mode 'fundamental-mode) -- I don't need the scratch buffer at startup. I have it a keybind away if I do. Starting text-mode at startup circumvents a couple startup optimizations (by eager-loading a couple packages associated with text modes, like flyspell), so starting it in fundamental-mode instead helps a bit.

    An odd one: tty-run-terminal-initialization adds a couple seconds to startup for tty Emacs users when it is run too early. After deferring it slightly, this doesn't appear to be an issue anymore. Not a big tty Emacs user, so YMMV.

<summary>Chromium</summary>
<p>
Most chromium based browers do not support anything more than marginal theming,
It is possible to affect a few changes by your gtk theme <a href="https://github.com/phocus/gtk/blob/master/scss/gtk-3.0/applications/_chromium.scss">[example</a>]

You can also make your own Chromium theme tho again, these are quite limited in scope: <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/themes/">https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/themes/</a>

Vivaldi however allows injecting CSS into the browser UI, I found a few links on it but your mileage may vary

<p>
You can customize the User Interface (Chrome) with Firefox CSS, see the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials">Getting started guide</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/">How to create & live debug userChrome.css</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.userchrome.org/">Collection of resources related to userChrome</a>
</li>
</ul><br/>You can use <a href="https://add0n.com/stylus.html">Stylus</a> to modify the appearance of certain websites.
<i>NOTE: Does not work on extension (except Stylus) and built-in browser webpages.</i>

Firefox also supports <code>userContent.css</code> for overriding the styles of a site, To use it simply follow the same instructions as for userChrome.css but create this file too in the same directory (chrome),
The structure of the file is usually as follows:
<pre>
<code><span style="color:#48bac2; font-weight:bold">&#64;-moz-document</span> domain<span style="color:#181818">(</span><span style="color:#38781c">&quot;discord.com&quot;</span><span style="color:#181818">) {</span>
	<span style="color:#898989; font-style:italic">/&ast; Your styles go here. &ast;/</span>
<span style="color:#181818">}</span>
</code>
</pre>
You can use any of the selectors available for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@document">@-moz-document</a>
<i>NOTE: Stylus can also export to this format for easy usage</i>

</p>
<h4 id="####-Start Page"> Start Page</h4>
<p>
You will need basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JS.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> is a nice place to learn.

Firefox has quite a few limitations on setting local files as your start page (no external requests or imports of any kind), so it may be easier to host your start page on some static site hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Surge.sh).

Then use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/">this extension</a> to set the URL.
Chromium users can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia">this</a> instead (Chrome places no limitations).

<summary>GTK</summary>
<p>
This is most easily accomplished by forking an existing theme and modifying them. Most themes are open source and
are easily modifiable (if you know CSS). Phocus is a nice one to start with since its code is clean scss and well structured, (<a href="https://github.com/phocus/gtk">https://github.com/phocus/gtk</a>)
*NOTE: Phocus is not a GTK2 theme so it will not show up in <code>lxappearance</code>, Set your gtk theme using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GTK#Basic_theme_configuration">settings.ini</a> instead,
this is because lxappearance expects a legacy gtk2 theme along with a gtk3, which modern themes do not have.*

You can use <code>gtk-widget-factory</code> to test your theme, it comes packaged with <code>gtk-demos</code> on arch & debian.
GTK CSS reference: <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html">https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html</a>
Using the GTK Debugger: <a href="https://elkowar.github.io/eww/working_with_gtk.html#gtk-debugger">https://elkowar.github.io/eww/working_with_gtk.html#gtk-debugger</a> (This should work anywhere)

Arch Wiki Link: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uniform_look_for_Qt_and_GTK_applications#Theme_engines">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Uniform_look_for_Qt_and_GTK_applications#Theme_engines</a>

By default, you have to apply themes for QT and GTK separately, with most GTK themes not having a QT counterpart.

To achieve a consistent look over both the styles, you can install <b>theme engines</b> like QGtkStyle (<a href="https://github.com/qt/qtstyleplugins">https://github.com/qt/qtstyleplugins</a>) or QGnomePlatform (<a href="https://github.com/FedoraQt/QGnomePlatform">https://github.com/FedoraQt/QGnomePlatform</a>).
These theme engines can be used to translate themes between GTK and QT platforms.

</p>
<h4 id="####-QGtkStyle"> QGtkStyle</h4>
<p>
After installing, you have to make changes the following changes

<b>For QT4:</b> Edit the /etc/xdg/Trolltech.conf (system-wide) or ~/.config/Trolltech.conf (user-specific) file:

~/.config/Trolltech.conf
<pre>
<code><span style="color:#a94598; font-weight:bold">[Qt]</span>
<span style="color:#48bac2; font-weight:bold">style</span><span style="color:#181818">=</span><span style="color:#9c5a02; font-weight:bold">GTK+</span>
</code>
</pre>

<b>For QT5:</b> set the environment variable <code>QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2</code>

<i>NOTE: This requires that the configured GTK theme supports both GTK 2 and GTK 3</i>

</p>
<h4 id="####-QGnomePlatform"> QGnomePlatform</h4>
<p>
This theme applies the appearance settings of GNOME for QT Applications. It is enabled by default on GNOME since version 3.20.
To enable it on other systems, after installing the qgnomeplatform package, set the environment variable:

<pre>
<code>QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME<span style="color:#181818">=</span>gnome
</code>

<summary>Neovim / Vim</summary>
<p>
This is an interesting one. If you use a premade colorscheme, chances are, a <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">base16</a> or other vim theme already exists for it. Otherwise, you can make a base16 theme or make one from a wide variety of templates. There even exist generators for it. (<a href="https://pintovim.dev/">Pinto</a>, <a href="https://bytefluent.com/vivify/">Vivify</a>)
And, of course, if a colorscheme is similar to yours, you can easily fork it and modify.

Besides colors, in terms of functionality you are free to find / forge whatever to fit your needs.

Since i've been writing a port for <a href="https://gitlab.com/snakedye/chocolate">chocolate</a>, this is a problem i've encountered, the real basic solution is to do:
<pre>
<code>function<span style="color:#181818">!</span> SynStack<span style="color:#181818">()</span>
  <span style="color:#a94598; font-weight:bold">if</span> <span style="color:#181818">!</span>exists<span style="color:#181818">(</span><span style="color:#c48218; font-weight:bold">&quot;&ast;synstack&quot;)</span>
    return
  <span style="color:#a94598; font-weight:bold">endif</span>
  echo map<span style="color:#181818">(</span><span style="color:#c48218; font-weight:bold">synstack(line(&apos;.&apos;), col(&apos;.&apos;)), &apos;synIDattr(v:val, &quot;name&quot;)&apos;)</span>
endfunc
</code>
</pre>

but this doesnt work that well for treesitter, in which case using <a href="https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground/blob/master/lua/nvim-treesitter-playground/hl-info.lua">this code from treesitter-playground</a> works a fair bit better,
to use them more easily, create a keybinding for <code>SynStack()</code> or <code>require('hl-info').show_hl_captures()</code> respectivley

<i>The definition of compositor changes from X11 to Wayland, I am talking about X11 only:</i>
Compositor is a thing that sits between your window manager and X11 and makes stuff like transparency work. Recently, however, compositors have been used to implement blur, rounded corners and animations for a window manager to behave more like a desktop enviroment.

If the version in your package repositories has the features you want, I'd suggest you use that instead.

</p>
<h4 id="####-I just want transparency and or shadow"> I just want transparency and or shadow</h4>
<p>
You're in luck, lots of choice for you. You can use <code>picom</code> / <code>xcompmgr</code> / <code>compton</code>, anything you want and generally it'll just work™

I still suggest using picom as it has the latest technology / optimizations, beside being the
most commonly used & most supported one.
<i>Forcing application transparency has very little purpose in most cases however, and most user interface's are not designed with that in mind (eg: nvim)</i> <span class="in-margin">⛔</span>

</p>
<h4 id="####-I want blur too"> I want blur too</h4>
<p>
Just build the latest <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom">master</a> and use picom with the --experimental-backends option.
To build picom from source, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom#build">README</a>
<i>Be very caution when using blur, excessive blur can make a rice look bad very easily.</i> <span class="in-margin">⛔</span>

</p>
<h4 id="####-I want rounded corners too"> I want rounded corners too</h4>
<p>
Again, picom master has the thing for you, picom has implemented rounder corners in the xrender and legacy glx backends.

A few window managers can draw rounded corners out of the box, so you might be able to utilize that. (afaik awesome can)

</p>
<h4 id="####-I want animations too"> I want animations too</h4>
<p>
Use one of the popular forks I guess :/, I don't know how well picom animations work, but I don't expect it to be spectacular.
The following are popular as of October 2021:
<a href="https://github.com/jonaburg/picom">jonaburg/picom</a>    -> slightly buggy sliding animations
<a href="https://github.com/dccsillag/picom">dccsillag/picom</a>  -> has cool, configurable animations
<a href="https://github.com/pijulius/picom">pijulius/picom</a>    -> fork of dccsillag, added animations and optimisations

<a href="https://github.com/Tanish2002/picom">Tanish2002/picom</a>-> also has animations, try if the others do not work

Example configuration with most of the available options: <a href="https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/next/picom.sample.conf">https://github.com/yshui/picom/blob/next/picom.sample.conf</a>
To get a window class for a exclude / include, use <code>xwininfo</code> or <code>xprop</code> & click the window you want.
Remember to use window classes whenever you can, window titles can be very finicky.
The 2nd part of the window class is the relevant bit, for example: 
For <code>Application.Navigator</code>, You would put <code>class_g = 'Navigator'</code> in your picom config
