			<h1>ðŸŒ¾ How do I rice X?</h1>
My own take at a ricing guide.
Most of it is useless if you already know, and it only covers the **very** very basics.

<h2>Firefox</h2>
You can customize the User Interface (Chrome) with Firefox CSS,
See the following:
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials">https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/wiki/index/tutorials</a>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/">https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/</a>

<h3>Start Page</h3>
You will need basic knowledge of HTML, CSS & JS
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> is a nice place to learn

Firefox has quite a few limitations on setting local files as your start page
( No external requests or imports of any kind ) so in my opinion, its easiest to simply host your start page on some static
site hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Surge.sh)

Then use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/">this</a> extension to set the URL.
Chromium Users can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia">this</a> instead (chrome places no limitations)

<h2>GTK</h2>
This is most easily accomplished by forking an existing theme and modifying them, Most themes are open source and
are easily modifiable (if you know CSS). Phocus is a nice one to start with. (<a href="https://github.com/phocus/gtk)">https://github.com/phocus/gtk)</a>

GTK CSS Reference: <a href="https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html">https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/css-properties.html</a>
Using the GTK Debugger: <a href="https://elkowar.github.io/eww/working_with_gtk.html#gtk-debugger">https://elkowar.github.io/eww/working_with_gtk.html#gtk-debugger</a> (This should work anywhere)

<h2>(Neo)Vim</h2>
This is an interesting one, If you use a pre - made colorscheme chances are a <a href="https://github.com/chriskempson/base16">base16</a> or other vim theme
already exists for it, Otherwise you can make a base16 theme or make one from a wide variety of templates,
There even exist generators for it. (<a href="https://pintovim.dev/">Pinto</a>, <a href="https://bytefluent.com/vivify/">Vivify</a>)

And of course if a colorscheme is similar to yours, you can easily fork it and modify.

Besides colors, in terms of functionality you are free to find / forge whatever to fit your needs.

<h2>Terminal</h2>
I am bored now.
