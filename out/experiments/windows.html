			<h1> Colemak</h1>
After installing the <a href="https://colemak.com/Windows">exe</a> from the colemak website...
You can easily enough change the language while using windows but it presents a program while being 
logging in (it uses the QWERTY layout at that time.),
The detailed <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/494-howto-set-colemak-as-windows-xp-login-screen-layout-and-more/">solution</a> can be found here.
/* I dunno why I felt like this was worth writing here. */

<h1> WSL2</h1>
I was honestly surprised how good it was, it is amazing how well WSL works!
Installation is a bit murky because the docs are spread out but basically all you need to do is follow the steps here:
<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps</a>

After that you can install a distrubtion from the microsoft store which is simple enough, you can install any distro of your choosing but
I think thats a fair bit more tricky.

<h2> Terminal</h2>
The choice should be obvious (I hope): The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal">windows terminal</a> works ootb with WSL and will even automatically add Distro profiles.
From there its just a few clicks and you're up and running with a almost perfect command line linux experiance!

<h3> Clipboard</h3>
Just right clicking to paste should work well for most things, but vim has a few issues with it, if you are using neovim though and you should be
This can be easily remedied:
<a href=https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#how-to-use-the-windows-clipboard-from-wsl>https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#how-to-use-the-windows-clipboard-from-wsl</a>

The rest should just work

<h2> Graphical Enviroment</h2>
WSL-G is a wip and rn only available for windows insiders so I havent got a chance to use it although it seems pretty slick.
You can however get X11 to work amazingly well via XRDP (X11 remote display ig ?)

- Install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">VcXsrv</a>
- Run <code>XLaunch</code>
- Select 'Multiple Windows' if you want applications to behave like regular applications in windows or
one large screen if you want to work within a linux de / wm
- Start with no client
- Tick disable access control !IMPORTANT!
- Add any additional arguments you may want from <a href=http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/manual.php#sect6>http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/manual.php#sect6</a>
- Run

& Add the following to SHELL-rc file and do <code>exec $SHELL</code>:
<pre><code>case "$(uname -r)" in
	*microsoft-standard-WSL2)
		# For WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux)
		export DISPLAY="$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'):0"
		export DISPLAY="$(sed -n 's/nameserver //p' /etc/resolv.conf):0"
		export DISPLAY=$(ip route|awk '/^default/{print $3}'):0.0
		export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
		;;
esac</pre></code>

Now just run any graphical program (like say <code>xterm</code>) and bam! it should show up in windows,
long as VcXsrv is running.

<h3> Filesystem</h3>
Accessing the linux filesystem from windows & vice versa

In Linux, accessing the Windows filesystem is as simple as navigating to <code>/mnt/c</code>
which represents the C: drive in windows

From windows, typing <code>\\wsl$</code> in the file explorer search box or the run box will navigate to a directory
with each distribution's <code>/</code> directory.

* Probably useful to setup shortcuts to these.

<h3> Web Servers</h3>
Since I got confused a bit here, they work exactly how you would expect,
You can access linux web servers from windows so
<code>localhost:5000</code> can be accessed as <code>localhost:5000</code> on windows too
