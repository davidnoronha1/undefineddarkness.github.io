			<h1> My thoughts on WSL2 (Windows Subsystem For Linux v2)</h1>
I was honestly surprised how good it was, it is amazing how well WSL works!
Installation is a bit murky because the docs are spread out but basically all you need to do is follow the steps here:
<a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps</a>

After that you can install a distrubtion from the microsoft store which is simple enough, you can install any distro of your choosing but
I think thats a fair bit more tricky.

<h2> Terminal</h2>
The choice should be obvious (I hope): The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal">windows terminal</a> works ootb with WSL and will even automatically add Distro profiles.
From there its just a few clicks and you're up and running with a almost perfect command line linux experiance!

<h3> Clipboard</h3>
Just right clicking to paste should work well for most things, but vim has a few issues with it, if you are using neovim though and you should be
This can be easily remedied:
<a href=https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#how-to-use-the-windows-clipboard-from-wsl>https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#how-to-use-the-windows-clipboard-from-wsl</a>

The rest should just work

<h2> Graphical Enviroment</h2>
WSL-G is a wip and rn only available for windows insiders so I havent got a chance to use it although it seems pretty slick.
You can however get X11 to work amazingly well via XRDP (X11 remote display ig ?)

- Install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">VcXsrv</a>
- Run `XLaunch`
- Select 'Multiple Windows' if you want applications to behave like regular applications in windows or
one large screen if you want to work within a linux de / wm
- Start with no client
- Tick disable access control !IMPORTANT!
- Add any additional arguments you may want from <a href=http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/manual.php#sect6>http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/manual.php#sect6</a>
- Run

& Add the following to SHELL-rc file and do `exec $SHELL`:
> case "$(uname -r)" in
> 	*microsoft-standard-WSL2)
> 		# For WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux)
> 		export DISPLAY="$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'):0"
> 		export DISPLAY="$(sed -n 's/nameserver //p' /etc/resolv.conf):0"
> 		export DISPLAY=$(ip route|awk '/^default/{print $3}'):0.0
> 		export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
> 		;;
> esac

Now just run any graphical program (like say `xterm`) and bam! it should show up in windows,
long as VcXsrv is running.
