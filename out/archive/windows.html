			<h1>Using Windows</h1>

This is gonna document my time, using the one and only Windows 10 :/
Mostly because nvidia forced me to but oh well...

<h2>Colemak</h2>
After installing the <a href="https://colemak.com/Windows">exe</a> from the colemak website...
You can easily enough change the language while using windows but it presents a problem while being 
logging in (it uses the QWERTY layout at that time.),
The detailed solution can be found <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/topic/494-howto-set-colemak-as-windows-xp-login-screen-layout-and-more/">here</a>.
// I dunno why I felt like this was worth writing here. 

<h2>WSL2</h2>
I was honestly surprised how good it was, it is amazing how well WSL works!
Installation is a bit murky because the docs are spread out (I am just dumb.) but basically all you need to do is follow the steps here:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps</a>

After that you can install a distribution from the microsoft store which is simple enough, you can install any distro of your choosing but
I think thats a fair bit more tricky.

<h2>Terminal</h2>
The choice should be obvious (I hope): The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal">windows terminal</a> works ootb with WSL and will even automatically add Distro profiles.
From there its just a few clicks and you're up and running with a almost perfect command line linux experience!

<h4>Clipboard </h4>
Just right clicking to paste should work well for most things, but vim has a few issues with it, if you are using neovim though and you should be
This can be easily remedied with the instructions here: <a href="https://0x0.st/N0sx">https://0x0.st/N0sx</a>

The rest should just work

<h4>Graphical Environment </h4>
WSL-G is a work in progress and right now only available for windows insiders so I haven't got a chance to use it although it seems pretty slick.
You can however get X11 to work amazingly well via XRDP (X11 remote display ig ?)

<ul><li>Install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/">VcXsrv</a>
</li><li>Run <code>XLaunch</code>
</li><li>Select 'Multiple Windows' if you want applications to behave like regular applications in windows or
one large screen if you want to work within a linux de / wm
</li><li>Start with no client
</li><li>Tick disable access control !IMPORTANT!
</li><li>Add any additional arguments you may want from <a href="https://0x0.st/N0sO">https://0x0.st/N0sO</a> 
</li><li>Run
</li></ul>& Add the following to SHELL-rc file and do <code>exec $SHELL</code>:
<pre class="code" data-language="sh"><code><span style="color:#e3ceab">case</span> <span style="color:#cc9393">&quot;$(uname -r)&quot;</span> <span style="color:#e3ceab">in</span>
	<span style="color:#dcdccc">*</span>microsoft-standard-WSL2<span style="color:#dcdccc">)</span>
		<span style="color:#7f9f7f; font-style:italic"># For WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux)</span>
		<span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">export</span> DISPLAY<span style="color:#dcdccc">=</span><span style="color:#cc9393">&quot;$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed &apos;s/nameserver //&apos;):0&quot;</span>
		<span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">export</span> DISPLAY<span style="color:#dcdccc">=</span><span style="color:#cc9393">&quot;$(sed -n &apos;s/nameserver //p&apos; /etc/resolv.conf):0&quot;</span>
		<span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">export</span> DISPLAY<span style="color:#dcdccc">=</span>$<span style="color:#dcdccc">(</span>ip route|<span style="color:#aae3b2">awk</span> <span style="color:#cc9393">&apos;/^default/<span class="reset">print</span> <span style="color:#c07abe">$3</span><span style="color:#cc9393"></span>&apos;</span><span style="color:#dcdccc">):</span><span style="color:#dca3a3; font-weight:bold">0.0</span>
		<span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">export</span> LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT<span style="color:#dcdccc">=</span><span style="color:#dca3a3; font-weight:bold">1</span>
		<span style="color:#dcdccc">;;</span>
<span style="color:#e3ceab">esac</span>
</code></pre>

Now just run any graphical program (like say <code>xterm</code>) and bam! it should show up in windows,
long as VcXsrv is running.

<h4>Filesystem </h4>
Accessing the linux file system from windows & vice versa

In Linux, accessing the Windows filesystem is as simple as navigating to <code>/mnt/c</code>
which represents the C: drive in windows

From windows, typing <code>\\wsl$</code> in the file explorer search box or the run box will navigate to a directory
with each distribution's <code>/</code> directory.

* Probably useful to setup shortcuts to these.

<h4>Web Servers </h4>
Since I got confused a bit here, they work exactly how you would expect,
You can access linux web servers from windows so
<code>localhost:5000</code> can be accessed as <code>localhost:5000</code> on windows too

<h2>De bloating Windows</h2>
This powershell script works rather well: <a href="https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater">https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater</a> for most of the obvious things anyway.
