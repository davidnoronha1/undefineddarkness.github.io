<h1>A day of fixing neovim terminal behaviour</h1>
</header>
<br/>
One day while fine tweaking my colourscheme, I noticed that my neovim wasn't displaying any italics<br/>
like I had specified in it. After double checking that everything was fine from my configuration side, I resolved it to be<br/>
something between neovim and the terminal.<br/>
<br/>
An hour of googling and trying a bunch of different fixes ensue, But most nothing happens till I try running neovim through the <code>env</code> program, forcibly overriding the <code>XTERM_VERSION</code> variable to be empty, This finally gave the correct behaviour.<br/>
Seems like some kind of bug?, Maybe its because my xterm is run in vt340 mode to allow sixel support (Yes, xterm has sixel!!!)<br/>
