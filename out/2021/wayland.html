<h1>My experience with wayland</h1>
</header>
This is intended to chronicle my adventures using Wayland<br/>
The primary reason being terrible performance in X11 but that was later resolved. :)<br/>
The journey continues tho ðŸ“”<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="window-manager (compositor) ">Window Manager (Compositor) </h2>
<p>
<i>I know its called a compositer but I am going to call it a window manager >:(</i>To fulfill this purpose I chose <a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway</a> as its the one I felt I could most get used to<br/>
since I had used its Xorg brother (i3) for a long while<br/>
<br/>
And..<br/>
It works really well! It's performance is very impressive compared to what I am used to<br/>
I have a few scruples with its configuration format and its refusal to add features i3 lacks but oh well..,<br/>
not like I'm gonna be writing my own compositor any time soon<br/>
<br/>
Coming from awesomewm, I would have liked to find something similar <br/>
and that sort of exists in the form of <a href="https://taiwins.org/index.html">Taiwins</a> but its very different from what I am used to <br/>
and I am not keen on using it as it is rather unstable and documentation is lacking<br/>
<br/>
</p>

<p>
What is the point of making a epic rice if there is no way to showcase it!<br/>
Wayland seems a bit more fiddly compared to the centralized xorg in terms of recording <br/>
but its not that bad. I had to use <a href="https://github.com/emersion/grim">grim</a> along with this <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/blob/master/contrib/grimshot">script</a> from sway to get<br/>
Nothing particularly difficult but not as cohesive as id like :/<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="moving-from xorg ">Moving from Xorg </h2>
<p>
This is a bit of a generic header but oh well<br/>
<br/>
Much to my surprise this wasnt as bad as I thought it would be,<br/>
rofi, wezterm, firefox & dunst - all programs I am used to from Xorg could work <br/>
natively (without Xwayland) on wayland<br/>
<br/>
Although most of them required tweaking in some form or another<br/>
<br/>
<b>ROFI:</b> This does use a fork
<pre>
	<code>git clone <span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">--recurse-submodules</span> https<span style="color:#dcdccc">://</span>github.com<span style="color:#dcdccc">/</span>lbonn<span style="color:#dcdccc">/</span>rofi
<span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">cd</span> rofi
meson setup build <span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">-Dwayland</span><span style="color:#dcdccc">=</span>enabled <span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">--prefix</span><span style="color:#dcdccc">=/</span>usr<span style="color:#dcdccc">/</span><span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">local</span>
ninja <span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">-C</span> build
ninja <span style="color:#dfdfbf; font-weight:bold">-C</span> build <span style="color:#aae3b2">install</span>
	</code>
</pre>
<p></p>
<b>FIREFOX:</b> Might need to modify some desktop files to get it to work right
<pre>
	<code>MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND&equals;1 firefox
</code>
</pre>
** Wezterm has issues with the wayland clipboard. I think using <a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot">foot</a> would be a better idea
** Firefox crashed more often for me in wayland but that may or may not happen to you

<h3 id="bars">Bars</h3>
<p>
Compared to the choice on X11, bars in wayland are a bit ehhhh ig
There are only 2 that I found:

<ul>
<li>Yambar:
	<a href="https://codeberg.org/dnkl/yambar">https://codeberg.org/dnkl/yambar</a>
</li>
<li>Waybar:
	<a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar</a>
</li>
</ul><br/>Since I couldn't compile yambar even tho it seems pretty nice :/ I was forced to use waybar
Both of them take after polybar very much which I personally am not much a fan off
but ig it makes sense, If I were to revisit the topic of bars I will definitely look into using
The one and only <a href="https://github.com/elkowar/eww/">eww</a> for this purpose.

<hr />
ðŸš§ This has been archived since I have not had the time to give a proper look at wayland, I do plan on looking at it again at some point,
since whether I like it or not, it seems to be the future of Linux Desktop
