<h1>Programming languages I like</h1>
</header>
Disclaimer: I havent used any of these languages for a long time or written a project of significant note<br/>
(except lua and javascript, those I know fairly well I think)<br/>
with any of them, These are just my opinons on them from what ive heard and what little ive tried of them.<br/>
So please take this with a grain of salt, üßÇ  <br/>

The languages in "Interesting" are ones I dont know particularly well...<br/>
So I might move them around when I finally get to learning them properly.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="###-Of particular note:"> Of particular note:</h3>
<p>
<br/>
<strike>I havent played with C#, but it looks really similar to Java so it gets to share its spot.It might be better than I've heard, no idea.</strike><br/>
I have played around with it a bit now and it is quite nice, finally understood OOP a bit while using it.<br/>
<br/>
Clojure is just a rather good lisp :)<br/>
Racket is lower because it isnt like clojure where it can leverage the JVM and its a bit umm slow, not to say clojure isnt slow, it is as well but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<br/>
<br/>
C is kind of fun to write in a way but it gets really frustrating pretty quickly,<br/>
I still havent been to write a C program without running into memory issues at least once, but I am not skilled with it.<br/>
But using Rust nets me most of the things I'd like to use C for and a far far better development experience so I haven't had much reason to learn it outside of curiosity.<br/>
Still waiting for Zig to be decent but looks like I'll have to wait a while.<br/>
<br/>
Lua might be the most <i>neat</i> & consise language I have ever seen, only everything you strictly need is<br/>
included, and almost all of it is really well designed. Not that remarkable a language tho,<br/>
and indexing from 1 (and its for loop syntax) might not have been the smartest idea but its not that hard to get used to.<br/>
Probably are some lisps that do the same thing.<br/>
