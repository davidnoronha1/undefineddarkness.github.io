			<h1>Programming languages I like</h1>

Disclaimer: I havent used any of these languages for a long time or written a project of significant note
(except lua and javascript, those I know fairly well I think)
with any of them, These are just my opinons on them from what ive heard and what little ive tried of them.
So please take this with a grain of salt, üßÇ  

<div class="ovr-x"><table class=" tierlist">

</tbody></table></div>

The languages in "Interesting" are ones I dont know particularly well...
So I might move them around when I finally get to learning them properly.

<h3>Of particular note:</h3>

I havent played with C#, but it looks really similar to Java so it gets to share its spot.
It might be better than I've heard, no idea.

Clojure is just a rather good lisp :)
Most lisp's are rather good tho
Racket is lower because it isnt like clojure where it can leverage the JVM and its a bit umm slow, not to say clojure isnt slow, it is as well but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

C is okay for small projects and toys but just dont use it for a big project ;-;
So many things better than it exist.
Im starting to hate it so much and sort of like it in ways :p
It has its purpose for a few things tho, so its not entirely without use.
Still waiting for Zig to be decent

Lua might be the most <i>neat</i> & consise language I have ever seen, only everything you strictly need is
included, and almost all of it is really well designed. Not that remarkable a language tho,
and indexing from 1 (and its for loop syntax) might not have been the smartest idea but its not that hard to get used to.
